Perform a code review of the terraform codebase provided. 
Identify any issues, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement in the code. 
Specifcally look for problems related to 
- Deployability and functionality
- Module interface consistency
- Code structure and organization
- Variable naming and usage
- Resource configuration and dependencies
- Security best practices (e.g., handling of sensitive data)
Summarize your findings and provide recommendations for addressing any problems you discover into a file and save it as `code_review_v[x].md`, where `[x]` is the next sequential version number based on existing files in the `plans` directory.This document confirms whether the reported issues are actually present in the current Terraform codebase under `environments'.
